Hey devclub guyzzz, well, initially I started with full enthusiasm  and did week1, but like when I begin with week2, I couldn't able to do it mainly due to 2 reasons first, like there were no daily meets or like someone 
who's guiding you (like I think a mentor will be good, who will be keeping in check of me), and due to this, it led to my burnout, since no one's there , like Lakshay sir used to ask about this, but I think if there were
like more interactions like regular meets or like discord channels, it might be much better.

Well, if I could get another chance to work in Gamedev under Devclub this time, it would be great since I really wanted to do this, but got a burnout, I hope for a 2nd chance to get better.
